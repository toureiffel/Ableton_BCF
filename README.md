Work based on datamafia's Baseline script by modern dj


This script is for Ableton Live 9 generic control needs.  Features include :

1. "Red Box" Relative control and navigation for clips in Session View
2. Navigation, including up, down, left, and right for navigation
3. Single MIDI channel use.
4. Mapping of Stop buttons, including Stop All
5. Scene Launch for the session view
6. Tempo control via button (note) events
    a. Definable increments (floating and non floating)
    b. Increments for add and remove are not required to match
7. Support for RGB LED feedback, especially Livid Instruments
8. Volume support in 2 forms
    a. "Red Box" control surface volume where the control moves with the navigation
    b. Static volume control with offsetting. This is for advanced control surface control where volume should not
    move with the box and often needs to be offset (okay, I really needed this, so you get it too! --M)

Of course features are left as "opt in" via the parameters file when possible, detailed here an and on the parameters.py file
